# Basics

Objects are declared with {} and are accessed using the dot notation or with square brackets using the key. Though this latter process is less desirable. 

An object is an important data dtructure as it often reflects real-world entities. They are made up of properties and methods. Allow you to "group" related data together.

Anything that is not a primitive value is an object.
