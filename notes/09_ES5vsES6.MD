# ES

Ecma Script is the language behind Javascript. In fact one could say that JavaScript is a variation of EcmaScript itself. 

Since ES6, changes are now added in a more incremental way. 

- ES5 is supported in all browsers, including old IDE but not var.
- ES6 is supported in modern browsers and can mostly be transpiled to ES5. It introduced many new features that help write cleaner, better and faster code. 

# Const, Var and Let

Const and Let are for ES6 while var has been used since es5.
